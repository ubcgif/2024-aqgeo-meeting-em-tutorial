## Installing the environment 

If you have conda installed, you can run 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

or take a look at the requirements in the [environment.yml](./environment.yml) file. 

**Note:** For improved efficiency, we recommend that you have `pydiso` installed on a computer with intel chips, or `python-mumps` if running on a new mac.
